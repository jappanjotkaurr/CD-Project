This project implements YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection, optimized using a Hybrid PSO-GWO (Particle Swarm Optimization & Grey Wolf Optimizer) to enhance model efficiency and reduce computation costs. The model is trained and fine-tuned to detect objects in images and videos with improved accuracy and speed.

Features:

Object Detection using YOLO

Hyperparameter Optimization with Hybrid PSO-GWO
